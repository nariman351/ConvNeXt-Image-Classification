# Image classification on Cifar-10 using ConvNeXt

(The Documentation is not yet complete.)

### Technologies Used:

PyTorch, TensorFlow, ConvNeXt, Feature Extraction, SVM, Logistic Regression, Feed Forward
Neural Networks, CNN, Bayesian Optimization


### Summary:
• Classified Images in the Cifar-10 dataset using state-of-the-art technologies,
namely ConvNeXt as a model and feature extractor.

• Modified the Architecture of the ConvNeXt model and retrained the
modified layers. Compared seven different machine learning models and
chose the top 3 (SVM, Feed Forward, Logistic Regression) for further
improvements. Utilized Bayesian optimization for the models.

• Attained 97.61 percent accuracy on the test set. External images were
also fed to the model from different sources to cross-examine the results
as a generalization set. 88.68 percent accuracy was recorded for
the generalization set.
